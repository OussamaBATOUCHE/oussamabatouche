</center>

<h3>Abstract </h3>
<h4>Introduction and Objectives</h4>Conflicting evidence exists for the effect of prostate cancer (PCa) treatment delay on outcomes after curative treatment. PCa is
generally slow-growing, and treatment delays up to 6 months have not been associated with impaired outcomes. However, the effect
of treatment delay on outcomes in intermediate PCa is more controversial, especially during the MRI era. In this study, we assess
the effect of delaying or expedited curative treatment (surgery or radiation therapy) on the time to treatment relapse.

<h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> We used the Helsinki University Hospital registry for data mining and to categorise PCa patients by Gleason grade group (1-5),
treatment (RP/RT), and follow-up outcome (BCR) for a final sample size of 11719 patients (1993–2019). A broader definition of
biochemical recurrence was established considering secondary treatments as an additional indicator of relapse alongside traditional
PSA cut-offs (PSA of 0.2 ug/l for surgery and PSA nadir +2 ug/l for radiation therapy). A joint survival model (utilising INLAJoint R
package) was employed to model the relationship between the time from diagnosis to curative treatment (treatment risk) and the
time from diagnosis to treatment recurrence (relapse risk).

<h4>Results:</h4> Conditional on covariates, including age at diagnosis and Gleason grade group, our joint survival model revealed a negative
association γ = -0.99 [-0.99, -0.81] between the risk of treatment and risk of treatment relapse. Regardless of the grade group,
individuals within the top 15% with the lowest risk of receiving treatment (i.e., the longest time to treatment) exhibited a 1.96 [1.05,
7.17] increased risk of recurrence compared to the average individual. Conversely, individuals within the top 15% with the highest
risk of receiving treatment (i.e., shortest time to treatment) showed a 0.51 [0.14, 0.95] decreased risk of recurrence. When fitting
separate models for each grade group, the association decreased in higher grade groups. Additionally, associations of delaying
treatment were higher than associations of earlier treatment.
